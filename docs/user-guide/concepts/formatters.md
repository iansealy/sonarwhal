# Formatters

A `formatter` takes the results of executing the configured rules and
transforms them to be consumed by the user. A `formatter` can output
the results via the `console` in different formats, a `JSON` file,
`XML`, etc.

You can specify one or more `formatter`s as the output. E.g.: You want
a summary in the screen as well as a text report. You just need to
add the name inside the property `formatters`:

```json
{
    "formatters": "formatter1"
}
```

or

```json
{
    "formatters": [
        "formatter1",
        "formatter2"
    ]
}
```

## List of official `formatter`s

The built-in `formatter`s are:

* `json` does a `JSON.stringify()` of the results. Output
  is not user friendly:

  line, and column:

* `codeframe` shows also the code where the error was found if: Will
  show the piece of code where the error was found (if applicable):
